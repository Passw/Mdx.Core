# mdx

## ARCHIVED

Archived codes but I miss its.


## ORIGIN

These codes works for loading mdx/mdd (MDict) file format.

Many years ago, I had done the back engineering on several mdx files. And I had made a GUI winforms app too.

It's rough, stormy and ugly, just works as is.

For those days with memories, The Codes be archived and saved to HERE now.
Of course, it has been pruned slightly and migrated to .NET Core so that a console app named `mdx` could be run at April 2020.
